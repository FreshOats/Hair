Investigation on shedding and hair loss


Metrics: 
- Growth rate: 0.35mm/day
- Thicker hair grows closer to 11.4 mm/mo (0.38/day)
- Thinner hair grows closer to 7.6 mm/mo (0.25/day)
- Brown hair: 110,000 hair follicles
- Anagen lasts 2-6 years
- Catagen and telogen last 3.5 months collectively
- 90% of hair follicles are in anagen
- 9% of hair is in telogen
- Most hairs that are shed are in telogen
- The scalp sheds 100 hairs per day

- In 99 days, the newest growth is already 1.3 inches long


0.38 mm/day * 365 days/year * 6 years = 832.2 mm, approximately 32.8 inches or 2.7 feet

110000 * 0.09 = 9900 hairs in telogen (ready to fall out)
110000 * 0.9 = 99000 hairs in anagen (growing)

If there are 9900 hairs in telogen, then it would be 99 days of losing 100 each, so this tracks.
That being said, as the hairs in telogen approach the 3 month mark, the follicle starts anagen over and releases these...
So about 100 new hairs are starting to grow per day. 

This means normal shedding is most likely a sign that you are starting to grow new healthy hair.

Notes: 

According to the AAD, it's normal to shed 50 to 100 hairs a day. When we shed more, it is called telogen effluvium, which can result from the following: 

- Loss of 20 lbs or more
- Given birth
- Experience high stress
- Had a high fever
- Undergone an operation
- Recovering from an illness
- Stopped taking birth control pills

This usually reverts back to the original state after some time.

Hair Loss is different. This occurs when the hair stops growing. This is referred to as anagen effluvium.
- Hereditary hair loss
- Immune systemns overreaction
- Certain drugs and medications or treatments
- Hairstyles that pull on the hair
- Harsh hair care products
- Compulusion to pull on hair

Hair serves many physiological and psychological functions. 


Physiology
- Growth rate is 0.35mm/day
- Approximately 0.5 in/mo or 6 in/year
- Most healthy men and women have 80,000 to 120,000 terminal hairs on their scalp
- Three phases in hair: 
    - Anagen, the growth phase. 
        - Lasts 2 to 6 years; primary growth occurs
        - 85% to 90% of hair follicles are in this phase
    - Catagen, transitional phase.
        - About 2 weeks 
        - Follicular regression occurs in this phase
        - The papilla detaches and rests, cutting off the hair strand from the blood supply
        - Ultimately, as the follicle closes up, the hair is pushed upward, but is much looser than a hair in the anagen phase
    - Telogen, the resting phase
        - Approximately 3 months
        - The hair is inactive and ultimately dies
        - Hair will be shed after the telogen phase
- The scalp sheds about 100 hairs per day
    - Can shed more with shampooing or other hair care practices


The pilosebaceous unit comprises the 
- Sebaceous Gland (oil production and lubrication)
- Arrector Pili Muscle (Goose bumps)
- Hair Follicle (produces the protein hair shaft)

Blood Supply and Lymphatics
- Blood vessels from deep in the dermal vascular plexus surround the hair follicle
- Deliver nutrients, eliminate waste, help with growth
- Loss of blood supply can impact hair loss
- Blood supply is an essential component to successful follicle growth, maturation, and maintenance

Nerves
- Two neural networks innervate hair and hair follicles, both containing sensory and autonomic fibers

Muscles 
- Arrector Pili, develops independent of follicle and connects at the hair follicle bulge
- These muscles mediate thermoregulation by contracting and raising the or relaxing and releasing the hairs
- May provide some support to follicle integrity and stability


Pathologies: 
Effluvium and Alopecia

Alopecia: hairlessness, complete loss of hair growth
    - Androgenic alopecia - 50 million men and 30 million women in the US
        - Male pattern baldness is alopecia
        - Women see widening part and thinning at the top of scalp
    - Alopecia Totalis
        - Entire scalp - baldness
    - Alopecia Universalis
        - Entire body
    - Alopecia areata
        - localized to specific areas
    - Traction Alopecia
        - Caused by adding too much strain on the hair on one's head (tight pony tails can lead to permanently suppressed growth)
    
    - Alopecia is an autoimmune disease mediated by T-lymphocytes and other immune cells

Effluvium: hair loss in which hair falls out
    - Telogen Effluvium - disruption in normal hair growth and rest cycles that results in excessive shedding and hair loss
        - Diagnosed with a pull test - if hair falls out very easily and 50% or more are in the telogen phase

[Promotion of anagen, increased hair density and reduction of hair fall in a clinical setting following identification of FGF5-inhibiting compounds via a novel 2-stage process](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5338843/)

Dominic Burg, Masakuni Yamamoto, Masato Namekata, Joseph Haklani, Koichiro Koike, Maria Halasz

Fibroblast Growth Factor-5 is an important factor in the trastiion from anagen to catagen, an irreversible change. Inhibition of FGF5 can prolong anagen.

Background: 
- 50% of men will present with PHL by the age of 50
- 70% of men will present with PHL by the age of 80

- 3-13% of women will present with PHL under the age of 40
- 32-54% of women over 70

Phases at any given time: 
- 90% of follicles are in anagen phase
- 1% are in catagen phase
- 9% are in telogen phase 


PHL has a reduced anagen phase and increased proportion in catagen and telogen, shifting to production of fine, short hairs ('< 2cm')

[Gender differences in scalp hair growth rates are maintained but reduced in pattern hair loss compared to controls](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/srt.12274)

DJJ Van Neste, DH Rushton

- Thicker hair (>60 um) grows faster (11.4 mm per month) than thinner hair (20-30 um) at (7.6 mm per month)
- The rate of growth between men and women was determined to not be significantly different
- Most people CANNOT grow hair longer than 2-3 feet
- People who can grow very long hair have genetic makeup such that the anagen phase doesn't go on to catagen
- There are alternative ways that people can enhance growth of hair beyond it's typical limit by prolonging the anagen phase

According to the BioNumber Harvard Database, the number of hairs on humans for different hair colors goes between 90,000 - 150,000 and goes like this:

Blondes (Light Yellow/Golden-haired) — 150,000
Brunettes (Brown-haired) — 110,000
Black haired — 100,000
Redheads — 90,000

Therefore, the ones with the thickest hair have hairs conversely related to the numbers, meaning 'thicker the hair, lesser is the number of strands of hair on the head.'

24 tips:
1. Get enough protein in your diet.
2. Eat a balanced diet rich in nutrients.

[STAGES OF THE HAIR GROWTH CYCLE](https://myhairdoctor.com/stages-of-the-hair-growth-cycle/)

- Most of the hairs that are shed are actually at the beginning of a new anagen cycle
- Formation of the new hair matrix loosens the resting dead hair in telogen
